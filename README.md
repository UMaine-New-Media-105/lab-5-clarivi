In this lab, there were two excersises based around a bouncing ball and working with keyboard input.

In the first exercise, we were tasked with creating a ball that constantly moved in an X and Y direction. When it hit the edge of the canvas, it will bounce, turning it's
movement in the opposite direction. The link to the sketch can be found here : https://editor.p5js.org/connorL/sketches/THeCjwUw_

In the second half of the exercese, we took the ball we made from the last exercise and made it respond to keyboard input, letting it influence its direction. We used the
keyPressed set of functions to recognize if the up or down arrow was pressed, and made the ball move in the respective direction. The link to the sketch can be found here: https://editor.p5js.org/connorL/sketches/ZOkpKDaR1
